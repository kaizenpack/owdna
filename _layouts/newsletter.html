<h3>Terms of Participation</h3>

<p>
  The Old West Durham Neighborhood Association email list is a service provided by the 
  Old West Durham Neighborhood Association (OWDNA) to encourage our values of community,
  harmony, and diversity.  Participation in this group is volunteer-moderated by OWDNA
  board members to serve the interests of the members of our community.
</p>

<p>
  Although moderation will be done leniently to encourage dialog, OWDNA reserves the right to filter 
  and/or block participation it feels is inconsistent
  with its mission or values, does not relate to Old West Durham and/or our surrounding community,
  is illegal or inappropriate in any way, or abuses the membership for advertising purposes.
  Examples of participation that is discouraged include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Advertising for services and/or events offered by organizations and/or people not associated with our community</li>
  <li>Excessive advertising for services within our community</li>
  <li>Personal or defamatory attacks on other community members</li>
  <li>Philosophical discussions not relevent to our community or region</li>
</ul>

<p>
  From time to time OWDNA reviews these terms and ammends them as necessary.  If you have
  recommendations for improvements to these terms or the moderation of the group, please
  attend the next OWDNA Board meeting.
</p>
